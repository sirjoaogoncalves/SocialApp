# SocialApp

Introducing SocialApp, a hands-on showcase of my full-stack development skills inspired by the Threads app.
SocialApp is more than a school project; it's a practical demonstration of my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, drawing inspiration from industry leaders. Welcome to a project that combines academic excellence with modern app trends.

## PLANNING

Design and Develop UI:
- Create necessary components using Chakra UI components.
- Design and implement the user interface.
- Add styling and responsiveness using Chakra UI.
- Implement navigation and routing using React Router.

Node.js + Express API:
- Set up the server (server.js).
- Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose and set up basic routes.

Develop REST API Endpoints:
- Define routes for various functionalities (CRUD operations).
- Create controllers to handle business logic for each route.
- Implement interaction with MongoDB using Mongoose for data storage and retrieval.

Test Your API Endpoints:
- Test the API endpoints using Postman.
- Ensure that data is being stored and retrieved correctly.

Connect React UI with Node.js Express API:

- Update React UI components to fetch data from the API.
- Connect UI components to relevant API endpoints.
- Ensure that data is being displayed correctly on the UI.

Add Authentication:
- Implement user authentication using JWT.
- Ensure that user data is securely stored and protected.
